Calculations of length-weight relationships for (any) two species and the resulting effect of binned length data (MEPS
  Figure 2). And then how the consequent binned body-mass values get assigned to
  logarithimic size-class bins by some methods (Figure 3).

```{r}
library(sizeSpectra)
```

## Figure 2 - example length-weight relationships for two species

```{r}
length_weight_plot()
```

## Figure 3 - how binned body-mass values get assigned to logarithmic size-class bins


```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height = 6}
bins_assignment_plot()
```

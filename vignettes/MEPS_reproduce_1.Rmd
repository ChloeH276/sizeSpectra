# Reproducing Figures 2, 3, TODO.... of MEPS paper

 See the
paper for details, the aim of the vignette is to enable users to reproduce the
results so that they can see what functions are appropriate for their own data,
and perform further analyses as required.

```{r}
library(sizeSpectra)
```

## Figure 2 - example length-weight relationships for two species

```{r}
length_weight_plot()
```

# Figure 3 - how binned body-mass values get assigned to logarithmic size-class bins


```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height = 6}
bins_assignment_plot()
```
